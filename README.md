Analysis Summary

The dataset represents the distribution of students in KCSE 2024 in Kenya, categorized by gender (boys and girls) and their grades. Here's a brief summary of the analysis:

  Total Students by Gender:
        A pie chart visualizes the overall proportion of boys and girls in the dataset.
        This shows a near-equal representation of both genders, with slightly more boys than girls.

   Key Insights:
        Gender Balance: Boys and girls have a strong correlation, meaning trends in performance are consistent across genders.
        Grade Trends: The dataset indicates that most students fall in lower grades, especially D, D-, and D+, while very few achieve top grades like A and A-.

  Takeaway:
        The strong gender correlation suggests systemic trends rather than gender-specific issues.
        The visualization highlights areas for targeted intervention, such as improving performance in the lower grades.
